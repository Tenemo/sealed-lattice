# sealed-lattice

`sealed-lattice` is a browser-oriented TypeScript and Rust/WebAssembly
prototype for threshold homomorphic polling. It explores how participants can
jointly run a poll, verify its public transcript, and release an agreed result
without revealing individual ballots or trusting a tally server.

The project is for synthetic data only. It has not been independently audited
or approved for production elections. Do not use it with real ballots,
credentials, keys, or secret material. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the
current security issues and required trust boundaries.

## How it works

The protocol is designed around a public transcript and participant-side verification:

1. A poll configuration and externally anchored participant roster define the ceremony and its threshold.
2. Participants contribute verifiable secret-sharing material and collectively derive the public and evaluation keys. No single participant holds the complete decryption key.
3. Voters encrypt bounded ballots and attach validity proofs.
4. Participant clients verify accepted records and homomorphically aggregate the encrypted ballots.
5. A deterministic evaluator computes the requested bounded result over ciphertexts, with a replay record that clients can check.
6. A finality quorum authorizes exactly one target result.
7. After finality, any reconstruction threshold of valid target-bound shares reveals only that approved result.

The roster and candidate-suite schemas cover `3 <= n <= 20`. The sole
implementation and evidence target is currently `n = 10`, with three actively
Byzantine participants, four reconstruction shares, and finality and state
quorums of seven. Other roster sizes remain unsupported.

Every required participant operation is intended to run in the participant's
own mobile browser. Transcript and mailbox services only relay untrusted bytes;
they are not trusted to prove, verify, tally, finalize, or decrypt.

## Prototype status

The kernel targets a fixed homomorphic-encryption candidate for the exact
`n = 10` prototype. The suite remains unavailable until its parameters, proof
construction, and evidence are frozen together.

Works today:

- The public package validates poll input and creates or verifies canonical
  foundation objects.
- The Rust/WebAssembly kernel recomputes their encodings, hashes, roots, roster
  formulas, and contexts.
- Browser-local custody, authenticated records, checkpoints, and fixed-roster
  state witnessing have focused desktop-browser coverage.
- Ballot encryption, aggregation, encrypted evaluation, and target release have
  focused component tests.
- All production proof-family preparation sites now use the streaming row-code
  and explicit-point WHIR construction. The old operative FRI body has been
  removed, and the successor has production-owned masked proof assembly,
  incremental canonical verification, bounded-storage primitives, and focused
  development tests.

Not yet:

- The successor is not cryptographically complete. Its current 64-way
  same-secret geometry does not match the pinned theorem certificate, and its
  current aggregate-wide pad uses a code rate whose exact agreement bound is
  too weak. The safer rate-one-quarter masking repair, exact
  transcript-to-theorem correspondence, and construction-level leakage proof
  remain unfinished.
- No full-width exact proof has completed on the current implementation, and no
  release WebAssembly proof has been generated and freshly verified across the
  desktop browsers. Recent guarded native attempts ended before proof emission,
  so their observed memory is diagnostic rather than completion evidence.
- No exact `n = 10` suite is frozen, no complete accepted vote runs end to end,
  and ballot, evaluator, and target-release operations are not public APIs.
- No physical-phone profile is qualified. Desktop-browser, Node.js, native, and
  fixture-backed runs are development evidence only.

## Install

Node.js 24.14.1 or later is required.

```bash
npm install sealed-lattice
```

or:

```bash
pnpm add sealed-lattice
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { createCanonicalManifest, validatePollSpec } from "sealed-lattice";

const pollValidation = validatePollSpec({
    pollId: "board-election-2026",
    question: "Which proposals should be adopted?",
    options: Array.from(
        { length: 20 },
        (_unused, optionIndex) => `Proposal ${optionIndex + 1}`,
    ),
    topOptionCount: 5,
});

if (!pollValidation.isValid) {
    throw new Error(
        pollValidation.errors[0]?.message ?? "Invalid poll specification.",
    );
}

const manifest = await createCanonicalManifest(pollValidation.normalized);
console.log(manifest.manifestHash, manifest.canonicalBytes);
```

`validatePollSpec` handles pre-protocol user input only. Protocol identity starts with the canonical manifest bytes and hash produced by the Rust/WASM kernel.

Import public APIs from the package root. Workspace packages, test fixtures, and internal source paths are not public API.

## Development

The repository uses Node.js 24.14.1 and pnpm 10.33.0.

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run check
```

Useful focused verification commands are:

```bash
pnpm run tsc
pnpm run build
pnpm run test:node
pnpm run test:browser
pnpm run test:rust:kernel
pnpm run smoke:pack:npm
```

Proof-heavy tests use separate guarded runners and are intentionally excluded from routine commands. Follow the repository instructions when changing proof or setup code.
